By the end of Week 3 - You should have completed Part 2 of Grok Academy
Spend half an hour each Block completing this - this is your starter and finisher for the day

Here are the files you should have saved in your Google Drive for helpful information
Variables
Comments
Math
Both files should have been saved in your Google Drive Folder and uploaded (committed) to Github

Another way instead of using .format, is using the f string that you have been learning about in Grok Academy

print(f"{num_1} + {num_2} = {add}")
